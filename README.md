# üçç Pineapple
Example app for feijoa

# Set up

This is a vue app, that runs using nodejs when in development mode. The version of nodejs to use is managed by
[nodenv](https://github.com/nodenv/nodenv). Install this. Then install the correct version of nodejs using:

```
nodenv install < .node-version
```


The vue command line interface is handy
```
npm install -g @vue/cli
```
